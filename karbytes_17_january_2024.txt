In order for a human individual to survive in the current configuration of human civilization on Planet Earth in the year 2024, that human individual must convince enough of "the right people" that the respective human individual is sufficiently useful to human civilization's continued survival and thrival.

The previous paragraph implies that unconditional access to (necessarily scarce) commodities which are needed by any and every human individual (in order for that human individual to survive and thrive (for at least one more "breeding or business cycle")) is hypothetical only and assumed to be impossible to physically implement as a standard universal practice without fail.

A human individual's most prized assets are neither its intellectual property (whether proprietary or open source) nor its physical property (whether sellable or not). Instead, a human individual's most prized asset is the (necessarily ephemeral and limited) "free will" which the military-industrial complex grants to that human individual (for some finite number of specific contiguous breeding or business cycles) exclusively on the condition that the particular human individual is deemed to be a member of "the right people" by sufficiently many of "the right people" (i.e. a human individual who identifies as, conforms to the stereotypical patterns of behavior of, and serves in a utilitarian manner the group of military-industrial complex assimilated human individuals).

A human individual must constantly renew its subscription to continued human existence (at least what "the right people" consider to be dignified human existence instead of what those people consider to be dangerous, painful, degrading, wasteful, and suicide or homicide inducing) by convincing "the right people" that the respective human individual is contributing enough utilitarian value to human civilization. Otherwise, that human individual is approved of by "the right people" (in a general consensus manner) to be ostracized, bullied, tortured, physically assaulted, stolen from, lied to, imprisoned, incapacited, crippled, censored, and ultimately set to atrophy and then die relatively quickly.

According to "the right people", the source and scope of anything worthwhile is approval and commands issued exclusively by "the right people" (as a unified hive-mind whole and not merely from the perspective of ideologically autonomous agents). Therefore, what that hive-mind considers to be intrinsic value is initially and finally extrinsic value (where "intrinsic" means "experienced in an entirely solipsistic manner (i.e. experienced by exactly one person for exactly one unique allocation of space-time) than experienced interactively in the context of a socioeconomic transaction involving multiple persons" while "extrinsic" means "experienced interactively in the context of a socioeconomic transaction involving multiple persons instead of experienced in an entirely solipsistic manner").

It is my request to be granted access to physician assisted suicide (especially using suicide pods which have recently been implemented by countries like Switzerland for eligible people with "incurable" physical or mental ailments) on condition that I am diagnosed with a terminal illness whose progression is expected to be very painful for me to experience and expensive and otherwise burdensome for other people to deal with or else decide that I am simply ready to surrender in the otherwise ongoing Darwinian battle for survival against "counter factors" such as (a) a build up of toxic chemicals and radiation in the environment and then in my body, (b) a decrease in my accessibility to survival and thrival commodities which are awarded to persons deemed by "the right people" to be more deserving of such commodities (especially families comprised of a heterosexual couple and exclusively that couple's minor offspring (especially if there are many children present in that family and relatively little income from those parents or those children working for other people in exchange for money or for commodities directly)), and (c) an implicit (or explicit) social mandate for me (and most other persons) to behave as though irreversible decline of (almost any person's but especially my) motor, sensory, and cognitive faculties followed by death by major organ failure are inevitable outcomes to living for any duration of time as a human individual (instead of insisting that age-related death and decline of faculties can be postponed indefinitely by technology and metaphysical loopholes). Also, and perhaps "most importantly", my goal in opting for physician assisted suicide (especially if it is not in response to me having a physical terminal illness such as cancer but, instead, in response to my ideological convictions and overall mental health condition) is to avoid taking commodities from those who need them "at least as urgently" as I "need" them and to avoid physically assaulting humans other than myself due to us being ideologically incompatible or simply in competition over scarce resources which we each demand access to (even while knowing there are not enough of such resources available to satisfy every human who is currently alive and who wants those resources). I do not think I would be experiencing intrinsic value sufficiently often and to a sufficiently profound extent for me to consider such circumstances worthwhile for me to invest finite resources in having more of (and at the expense of other people's well-being to boot). Therefore, I would rather dematerislize than participate in such savagery.
